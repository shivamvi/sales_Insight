### AtliQ hardware
##### This file contains all the code dashboard along with the Inference for the Exploratory Data Analysis on the AtliQ hardware. I have attempted to understand the Key motivations for the  AtliQ hardware sales and to identify any patterns if they exist. Obtained insight on key factors that influence the sales such as top customers/worst-performing customers, region-wise sales, Identified top-performing products, and worst-performing products, revenue growth/trend over the year, revenue contributors and etc.
